- Instead of defining data in controller we will query it from database 
- in gradle model is called as domain. 

- lets take domain as spreadsheet. 
- columns as different attributes, row as data in doman. 
- Three fields we have are Name,  SKU, Price. 
- Name and SKU contain character, Price as Floating. 

Right click Domain and create "Prodcut" as our domain class. 
it will create two files: 
grails-app/domain/myra/Product.groovy    // Product Domain class file. 
src/test/groovy/myra/ProductSpec.groovy   // test file

 // lets define different fields in our domain
    String name
    String sku
    Float price
    
    When we save it, tables are automatically created in database. 
    We can access dbcosole for grails here: 
    
    **http://localhost:8080/h2-console**
    we will connect to Dev db for now: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb
    // 3 different db that ship wjth grails are : test, dev and prod. 
    
    Once in Db, we can run queries as follows: 
    SELECT * FROM PRODUCT 
    
    Name, Price and sku are columns we have added
    GRails will add by default : ID and Version column too. 
    
    Edit and add data as needed
    Added 3 rows 
 Note: we will loose this data if we stop the application. 
 
 Next we will define new action and capture data we entered in database. 
 
 def list(){
 
         def allProducts  = Product.list(); // This will give everything stored in Product domain to allProducts variable.
          [allProducts:allProducts]  // pass to placeholder allProducts which can be now viewed in list view.
 
 
     }

Next, we will add new gsp under Inventory folder in view and refer this placeholder. 

<body>

  ${allProducts.name }
  ${allProducts.sku }
  ${allProducts.price }

</body>

Now when we check this url : http://localhost:8080/Inventory/list
it will display dummy data just enteted by us: 
[breakdfat, fflhwewe] [BB01, CD01] [22.33, 322.22]

Lets format this data into table and display in view. 
This gives much better presentaiton of data in table form.
