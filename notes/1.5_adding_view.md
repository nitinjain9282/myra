- added new action edit() and defined two variables : productName , sku
- When forwarding contents to view, we need to put variables in placeholder which may or maynot have different name as variable
- View will have same name as action it corresponds to. 
- Also view should be under same name as Controller so we will create view under:  grails-app/views/inventory
- No other special configuration requried. 
- To reference our placeholder we can just refer it using ${placefolder}

http://localhost:8080/Inventory/edit will now render edit view page with data passed from edit action.
